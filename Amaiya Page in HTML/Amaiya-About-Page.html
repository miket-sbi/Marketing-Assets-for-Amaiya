    <h2>For over two decades, <em>SBI Software</em> has grown alongside the grower industry—through market shifts, new regulations, evolving technologies, and the changing needs of growers and operators. We've seen trends come and go, systems rise and fall, and businesses transform. Through it all, our focus has stayed the same: supporting the people who rely on our software every day.</h2>

    <p>Today, we're entering a new era of technology with artificial intelligence. For many, AI brings excitement—but also uncertainty. At SBI, we don't just want to prepare our clients for what's coming. We want to walk beside them through it.</p>

    <p>Our mission is to be a trusted guide in this new generation of AI—educating, empowering, and reassuring. We believe AI should feel accessible, understandable, and human-centered. We're committed to explaining what it can do, what it can't do, and how it can truly improve daily operations without replacing the expertise and intuition that growers already bring.</p>

    <h1>Growing Together: Why We Chose Employee Ownership</h1>

    <p>We believe that the people who build a company should share in the value it creates.</p>

    <p>For years, we've watched the growing divide between massive corporations and small, mission-driven companies. Too often, success flows upward and outward—away from the employees who showed up every day, solved the hardest problems, and carried the business forward. That never sat right with us.</p>

    <p>During the pandemic, everyone struggled. The world slowed down, uncertainty set in, and businesses everywhere had to rethink what really mattered. At the same time, our industry surged. Demand for plants exploded, and our company grew alongside the growers we serve. That moment forced us to ask a hard question: <strong>If the company succeeds, who truly benefits?</strong></p>

    <p>We knew we wanted a future where employees could retire with dignity. Where the shared dream of opportunity wasn't reserved for founders, investors, or executives—but extended to every person who helped build the business. Profit sharing alone wasn't enough. We wanted something fair, lasting, and meaningful.</p>

    <p>That's why we began exploring an <strong>Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)</strong>.</p>

    <p>This ESOP doesn't replace how we reward our team—it strengthens it. We will continue to look into ways to increase the quality of life for our employees. In many niche industries, the story ends the same way: a larger company buys a smaller one, grows it, and eventually sells it again—often leaving employees behind and the industry with a gap. We've never believed that was fair. Our employees built this company. It shouldn't be stripped for parts or sold off to the highest bidder. We want our clients, partners, and the industry to know this clearly: <strong>We are not selling out. We are not walking away. We are committed to this industry for the long haul.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>This isn't just a business decision.<br>It's a belief in fairness, dignity, and shared success.</strong></p>
