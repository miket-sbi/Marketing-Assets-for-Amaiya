    <h1>AI & Database Interaction</h1>

    <p>A database stores everything your operation records — inventory, input costs, climate logs, SKU performance — all organized and searchable. AI connects to that database, reads through all of it at once, and looks for patterns and connections that would take a person weeks or months to find manually. When AI spots something useful — like a variety that performs better under certain conditions, or an irrigation schedule that's quietly costing you yield — it pulls that insight straight from the data you already have. The database is the memory, AI is the brain reading it, and the more complete your records are, the sharper the answers get.</p>

    <h1>What Is Good Data Management?</h1>

    <p>For growers, your ERP holds critical information — crops, varieties, SKUs, pricing, production schedules, inventory levels, customer orders, and historical sales. But the value of that system isn't just in collecting data. It's in how well that data is maintained. When an AI model connects to your ERP, it learns from your historical data patterns. If that data is inconsistent or incomplete, the AI will struggle to identify true trends.</p>

    <h3>Clean data means:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>No duplicate customer, crop, or inventory records</li>
      <li>Standardized naming conventions for varieties and SKUs</li>
      <li>Accurate historical sales and production numbers</li>
      <li>Correct units of measure (flats, trays, liners, etc.)</li>
      <li>Properly formatted dates, quantities, and pricing</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>When data is clean:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reports are faster and more reliable</li>
      <li>Inventory levels are trustworthy</li>
      <li>Forecasting becomes more accurate</li>
      <li>Production planning becomes smoother</li>
      <li>Teams spend less time fixing errors</li>
    </ul>

      <br><br><strong>Common issues shown:</strong> Typos &amp; Barcwork | Inconsistent Naming | Missing Fields | Data Entry Errors
      <br><br><strong>Bad Data example:</strong> Misspelled names, uncertain quantities, and vague database make data unreliable. (Shows table with items like "Red Geran" with quantity "10000??" and location "@ 1 I marked?")
      <br><br><strong>Good Data example:</strong> All managed, organized entries. (Shows clean table with "Cerastium, fac – 4.5" pot", qty "300 trays", size "70 (cell/teh)", location "Greenhouse A, Zone 2")
