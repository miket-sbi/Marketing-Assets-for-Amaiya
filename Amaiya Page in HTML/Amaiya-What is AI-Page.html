    <h1>What is AI & Why Should You Care?</h1>

    <p>Artificial Intelligence isn't science fiction — it's a practical tool that learns from your existing ERP data to automate decisions and reveal hidden opportunities.</p>

    <h3>AI Learns From Your Data</h3>
    <p>Every transaction, harvest record, and payment you've logged in our ERP becomes training data. AI spots patterns humans simply can't see across thousands of records — like which buyers consistently pay late or which batches yield higher margins.</p>

    <h3>Automation, Not Replacement</h3>
    <p>AI doesn't replace your expertise — it amplifies it. Instead of spending hours compiling reports or chasing invoices, AI handles the repetitive work so you can focus on growing your business and improving your operations.</p>

    <h3>Predict, Don't React</h3>
    <p>Traditional growing relies on reacting to market changes after they happen. AI flips this by analyzing trends, weather data, and market signals to forecast demand, pricing, and yield — giving you a competitive edge before decisions need to be made.</p>

    <h3>Your Data Stays Yours</h3>
    <p>All AI processing happens securely within our platform. Your data, financial records, and business insights are never shared with competitors or third parties. You own the intelligence — we protect the source.</p>

    <span class="btn-tag">SCHEDULE A DEMO</span>

    <p>More growers are starting to use AI alongside their ERP because it's giving them one thing they never have enough of—<strong>time</strong>. Instead of manually digging through reports, spreadsheets, and dashboards, AI can instantly summarize data, flag issues, and surface insights that would normally take hours. Tasks like forecasting yields, tracking inventory, and answering operational questions now take seconds, not meetings. The result is fewer late nights in front of a screen and more time focused on growing, strategy, and actually running the business—while still staying ahead of the numbers.</p>

    <h2>Different AI Models</h2>

    <h3>GPT - OpenAI</h3>
    <h4>Balanced All-Around Operator</h4>
    <p>ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is generally considered the most balanced all-around AI model. It's strong at reasoning, conversation, business workflows, writing, coding, and turning complex information into clear explanations. Many people use it as a "general operator" because it blends analysis with execution and communication, making it useful for strategy, automation, and day-to-day operational tasks across many industries.</p>

    <h3>Claude - Anthropic</h3>
    <h4>The Deep Thinker</h4>
    <p>Claude, created by Anthropic, is especially known for deep reasoning and its ability to analyze extremely large documents and datasets. Its large context capacity allows it to process long reports, complex spreadsheets, and database-like information in a single workflow, which makes it strong for enterprise research, structured analysis, technical documentation, and detailed operational or tailored data interpretation.</p>

    <h3>Gemini - Google Deepmind</h3>
    <h4>Ecosystem-Driven Analyst</h4>
    <p>Gemini, developed by Google, focuses heavily on real-time information and integration with the broader Google ecosystem. It performs well when tasks involve live web research, cloud tools, search-driven analysis, and multimodal inputs such as images or documents, making it particularly useful for workflows connected to online data, marketing analytics, and fast-changing information environments.</p>
